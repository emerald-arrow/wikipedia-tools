# Wikipedia tools
In this repository I store scripts that help me edit Wikipedia articles about endurance racing. Scripts are split into two directories:
* Scripts in **enwiki** are supposed to be used for editing English Wikipedia
* Scripts in **plwiki** are supposed to be used for editing Polish Wikipedia, they have Polish instructions

Scripts require Python version 3.13 to run.
